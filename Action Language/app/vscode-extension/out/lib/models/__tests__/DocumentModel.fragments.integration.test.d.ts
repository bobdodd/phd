/**
 * Integration tests for DocumentModel with multiple disconnected fragments
 *
 * These tests verify that Paradise can handle real-world scenarios where
 * developers work with disconnected component fragments during incremental
 * development, before components are integrated into a complete page tree.
 *
 * Scenarios tested:
 * - Multiple independent component fragments
 * - Cross-fragment ARIA references
 * - Event handlers split across fragments
 * - Merge process with fragment arrays
 * - Analyzer behavior with fragmented trees
